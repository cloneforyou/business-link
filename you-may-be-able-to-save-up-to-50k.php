		<h2>Regional employer NICs holiday for new businesses</h2>
		<p>The Regional Employer National Insurance contributions (NICs) holiday is available to new businesses for a limited period and subject to meeting certain conditions. New businesses may be able to qualify for a reduction of up to &pound;5,000 of the employer NICs that would normally be due - for each of the first ten employees they take on. This means a potential aid to business of up to &pound;50,000.</p>
		<p>This page contains everything you need to help you decide if you are eligible to apply and what you should do next.</p>
