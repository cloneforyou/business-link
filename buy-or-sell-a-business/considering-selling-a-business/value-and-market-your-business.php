		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<img src="../../_img/FB0330.gif" width="78" height="118"  alt="" />
		<p>Selling a business has two crucial elements - finding potential buyers and negotiating a price. It's essential to make your own estimate of value at an early stage so that you are clear about the value you can expect to realise and the most appropriate methods to manage the sale.</p>
		<p>This guide explains the key factors affecting the value of your business, and the different ways a value can be calculated. It also explains how to find potential buyers and how to approach them.</p>
