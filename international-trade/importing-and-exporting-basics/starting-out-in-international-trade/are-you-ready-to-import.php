			<p>Suppliers around the world offer a wide variety of goods that might suit your business. You might be able to find lower-priced supplies, giving you a competitive edge, or new supplies that allow you to sell a completely different product. Just as when you buy within the UK, it's important to find good suppliers, make sure they offer what you want and negotiate the right deal. </p>
			<p>But importing also presents complications, such as managing long-distance relationships and organising international transport and customs clearance. It's important to be sure that you are ready to import before you commit yourself.</p>
