			<p>However good your product or service is, the simple truth is that no-one will buy it if they don't want it or believe they don't need it. And you won't persuade anyone that they want or need to buy what you're offering unless you <b>clearly understand</b> what it is your customers really want.</p>
			<p>Knowing and understanding <b>customer needs</b> is at the centre of every successful business, whether it sells directly to individuals or other businesses. Once you have this knowledge, you can use it to persuade potential and existing customers that buying from you is in their best interests.</p>
			<p>This guide tells you what you <b>need to know</b> about your customers, how to use this information to sell more <strong>effectively</strong>, and how to win business from your competitors.</p>
