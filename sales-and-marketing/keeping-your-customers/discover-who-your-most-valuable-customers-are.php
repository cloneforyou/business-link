		<h2>Introduction</h2>

		<p>It's easy to assume that customers who spend the most money on your goods or services are also your most valuable. But that's not always the case. There are other factors you should consider, like:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the size and frequency of their orders</li>
			<li>the profit you make on their orders</li>
			<li>the amount of time you spend with the customer pre-purchase and post-purchase</li>
			<li>how quickly they pay</li>
			<li>whether they bring in additional customers</li>
			<li>any non-financial value they may offer your business</li>
		</ul>

		<p>This tool will take less than 5 minutes to complete and can help you maximise your profit by identifying your most valuable customers. It will help you analyse the behaviour of an individual customer compared with your estimate of an average customer.</p>
		<p>At the end you'll get an appraisal and summary of that customer's value to your business.</p>
