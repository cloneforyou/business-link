		<h1>Market research and market reports</h1>
		<h2>Customer research: what you need to know</h2>
		<p>Carrying out customer research on loyalty, satisfaction and service can make a big difference to your business. If you know how your existing and potential customers make their buying decisions, you can adapt your sales methods to fit their needs.</p>
		<p>Knowing such things as your customers' gender, age, occupation, income, lifestyle and attitudes can help with your marketing and sales plans. But knowing what they think of your products and service and how they rate you against your competitors will enable you improve your business' offering.</p>
		<p>To target your customers successfully, you should know as much about their buying habits as possible. To find out what questions you should be asking, see the page on <a href="/sales-and-marketing/keeping-your-customers/know-your-customers-needs/ten-things-you-need-to-know-about-your-customers.php">ten things you need to know about your customers</a> in our guide: <a href="/sales-and-marketing/keeping-your-customers/know-your-customers-needs.php">know your customers' needs</a>.</p>
