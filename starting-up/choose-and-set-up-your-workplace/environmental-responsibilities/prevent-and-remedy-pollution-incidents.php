			<h1>Environmental responsibilities</h1>
			<h2>Prevent and remedy pollution incidents</h2>
			<p>Every year there are thousands of cases of damage to the environment. The <strong>Environmental Damage Regulations</strong> relate to the most serious cases, covering:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>damage to species and habitats</li>
				<li>damage to water</li>
				<li>risks to human health from contamination of land</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The regulations apply to both actual cases of damage and threats of imminent damage. If you are responsible - ie you are the 'operator' of the activity that causes or threatens the damage - you must take immediate action to prevent or remedy this.</p>
			<p>See our guide on <a href="/environment-and-efficiency/preventing-and-managing-pollution/pollution-incidents-and-environmental-damage-an-overview.php">pollution incidents and environmental damage - an overview</a>.</p>
			<h3>Reporting an incident</h3>
