		<h1>Starting a business: the basics</h1>
		<h2>What are your start-up options?</h2>
		<p>When considering starting a business, you should think about the different options available to you. You might want to start your business full-time or part-time, or even in your spare time. You could choose to work from home or separate premises, to buy an existing business or to invest in a franchise, depending on your experience, lifestyle and resources.</p>
		<p>You should also think about assessing your own skills and where you might need some extra development or support - for example, looking after the business' finances.</p>
		<p>The following material will help you to understand your options and choose which business is right for you:</p>
