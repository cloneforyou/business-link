		<h1>Thinking about starting a social enterprise?</h1>
		<h2>Benefits of a social enterprise</h2>
		<p>Social enterprises need to generate revenue for sustainability but they also have equally important social and/or environmental aims. The requirement to manage this 'multiple bottom line' - financial, social and environmental - can result in unique challenges. However, the ability to bring about positive change to people and communities can be enormously satisfying and provide a means of making a living.</p>
		<p>One of the benefits of running a social enterprise can be in providing employment for local people. This may include people who have traditionally found it hard to enter the labour market. A social enterprise can be the ideal environment for such people to develop their potential - either as an employee or heading up their own operation. The types of individual who can benefit from running or working in a social enterprise include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the long-term unemployed</li>
			<li>people looking for a career change</li>
			<li>people with learning disabilities</li>
			<li>disabled people</li>
			<li>people with mental health issues</li>
			<li>ex-offenders</li>
			<li>minority ethnic groups</li>
			<li>women</li>
			<li>young people - many schools now have pupil-run social enterprises</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Some groups of people may find it difficult to work within the limitations of a traditional working environment. Social firms are an example of social enterprise businesses that have been set up to remove these barriers to employment and offer a more flexible approach to work. <a href="http://www.socialfirmsengland.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Find information on employing disadvantaged people in social enterprises on the Social Firms UK website</a>.</p>
		<p>If you set up a social enterprise in your local community, you are likely to witness the social benefits first hand. For example, you could run a social enterprise that matches up people in need of flexible employment, such as parents of young children, with elderly or vulnerable people in need of care in the same neighbourhood.</p>
		<h3>Marketing social enterprises</h3>
		<p>Social enterprises need to be competitive in any environment in which they operate. Attracting customers is vital to success. Highlighting the social and/or environmental credentials of your service/product, could give you the edge over your competitors.</p>
