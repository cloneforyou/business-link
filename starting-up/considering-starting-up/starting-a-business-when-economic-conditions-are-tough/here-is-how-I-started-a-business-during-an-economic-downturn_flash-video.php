		<p>Siggi sold his first collection of hats to Harvey Nichols in 1982 and was soon supplying boutiques and department stores with hats on a wholesale basis. In 2000, he opened a shop in West London to develop the retail side of his business. Siggi Hats has remained a small but flexible business - Siggi sees flexibility as key to survival during an economic downturn.</p>
