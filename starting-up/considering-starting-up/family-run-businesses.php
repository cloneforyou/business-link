		<h1>Family-run businesses</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>

		<p>A family-run business is typically one in which more than half the shares are controlled by members of the same family, or one that has been passed between generations.</p>
		<p>Starting, leading and working in a family business can bring valuable benefits compared with other businesses - from greater trust between staff to increased flexibility. However, without careful management there can also be problems - from family members lacking critical skills, poor communication to clashes over pay.</p>
		<p>This guide sets out the main advantages that come with running a family business. It also looks at some of the key challenges and suggests ways these can be channelled to become positive forces for business growth and success.</p>
