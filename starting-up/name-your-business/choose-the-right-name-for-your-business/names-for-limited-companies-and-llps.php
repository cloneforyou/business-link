		<h1>Choose the right name for your business</h1>
		<h2>Names for limited companies and LLPs</h2>
		<p>If you have decided to form a limited company or limited liability partnership (LLP), you must register your name and other details with Companies House.</p>
		<p>It is essential to check first that your proposed name does not breach the rules on name endings, 'same as' rules or include a prescribed or sensitive word without permission.</p>
		<h3>Company and LLP names - the rules</h3>
		<p>To make sure the name you choose is acceptable, work through this list before you send your application to Companies House. Ensure that your name:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>ends with 'limited' (or Ltd), 'public limited company' (or plc) or Welsh equivalents if you are a company</li>
			<li>if you have a limited liability partnership your name ends with 'limited liability partnership' or LLP (including Welsh equivalents) if you are an LLP</li>
			<li>isn't offensive</li>
			<li>isn't the same as one already on the index of company names</li>
			<li>doesn't include any sensitive words or expressions - unless you have obtained permission to use them</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Trade marks</h3>

		<h3>Complaints about company or LLP names</h3>
		<p>You can make a complaint about a company or LLP name to Companies House if:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the name is too similar to an existing company or LLP name</li>
			<li>within five years of registration, it is found that misleading information was given at the time of registration</li>
			<li>within five years of registration any conditions attached to the registration have not been fulfilled - eg the provision of support documentation for a sensitive name</li>
			<li>the name is misleading and as a result may cause harm to the public</li>
		</ul>
