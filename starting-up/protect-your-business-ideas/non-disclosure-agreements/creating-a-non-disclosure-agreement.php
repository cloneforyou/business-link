			<h1>Non-disclosure agreements</h1>
			<h2>Creating a non-disclosure agreement</h2>
			<p>A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) could suit you if you want to approach industry contacts such as a potential buyer, supplier, customer or partner.</p>
			<p>In the agreement, it is a good idea to specify:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>how the information can be used</li>
				<li>any restrictions on the use of the information you provide, eg preventing the recipient from making copies</li>
				<li>that the owner retains the intellectual property rights, copyright or possible patents</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The key clauses will be those detailing:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>protection against the copying or retention of confidential information</li>
				<li>protection against disclosure of information not already in the public domain</li>
				<li>a remedy, eg compensation, for any breach of the agreement</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Before drawing up an NDA ensure that the information you are seeking to protect cannot be construed as being in the <strong>public domain</strong>. Once you demonstrate your product, tell someone about an idea or write about it, it can no longer be considered confidential.</p>
			<p>Under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 public bodies will usually reject any confidentiality agreements that relate to the terms of the contract, its value and performance. It is a good idea to ask public bodies if they have a confidentiality agreement or NDA which meets the terms of the Act.</p>
			<p>You can <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120729155638/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/p-cda.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find out about confidentiality on the Intellectual Property Office website</a>.</p>
			<p><strong>Physically secure</strong> your confidential information. In any legal action for breach of confidentiality, the courts would be reluctant to treat information as secret that you had not taken practical steps to protect.</p>
			<p>Such measures could include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>locking confidential information away</li>
				<li>limiting the number of people who can access the information</li>
				<li>ensuring you have up-to-date IT security systems in place</li>
			</ul>

			<p>It also helps if you have a company <strong>policy</strong> regarding the use and disclosure of confidential information.</p>
