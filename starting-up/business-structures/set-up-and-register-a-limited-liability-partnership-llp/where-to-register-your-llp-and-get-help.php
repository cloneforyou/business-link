			<h1>Set up and register a limited liability partnership (LLP)</h1>
			<h2>Where to register your LLP and get help</h2>
			<p>Companies House can advise you on the registration process for a limited liability partnership (LLP), but cannot give you detailed advice on drawing up the necessary documentation.</p>
			<p>You can register your LLP yourself by completing application form LL IN01 and sending it along with the fee to Companies House. Fees payable are outlined below in the section: 'The cost of registration' below.</p>
			<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-a-limited-liability-partnership-ll-in01" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download form LL IN01 from the Companies House website (PDF, 866K)</a>.</p>
			<p>Although you can register your LLP yourself, it is a good idea to seek professional advice. A company formation agent, solicitor or accountant can carry out the process for you, for a fee, as well as offer advice. A solicitor will also be able to help you draw up your deed of partnership. To find your nearest company formation agent, solicitor or accountant, look in your local telephone directory or search online. Many incorporation agents and software providers are now able to offer their customers a web-based electronic service which is an easier and quicker way for you to register your LLP (this is chargeable).</p>
			<p><a href="http://solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search for a qualified solicitor on the Law Society website</a>.</p>
			<p><a href="https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20130420094152/http://www.accaglobal.com/en/discover/find-accountant.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search for a chartered accountant on the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) website</a>.</p>
			<p>You may not be able to use the LLP name you want if that name is the same as that of another LLP or company on the registrar's index of company names held at Companies House.</p>
			<p>There is an exception to this if an existing LLP or company is in the same group as your LLP and consents to the use of your proposed LLP name. See our guide on <a href="/starting-up/name-your-business/rules-for-naming-your-limited-company-or-limited-liability-partnership-llp.php">rules for naming your limited company or limited liability partnership (LLP)</a>.</p>
