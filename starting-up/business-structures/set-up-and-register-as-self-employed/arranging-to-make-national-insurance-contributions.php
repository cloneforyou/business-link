			<h2>Arranging to make National Insurance contributions</h2>
			<p>As well as registering with HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) so that they can set up records for your tax and National Insurance contribuions (NICs) you'll need to arrange to pay Class 2 NICs. For the tax year 2011-12 the Class 2 NICs rate is &pound;2.50 a week.</p>
			<p>The most convenient way to pay Class 2 NICs is via Direct Debit. Paying by Direct Debit has many advantages:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>it's easy to set up - just fill in the application form and send it to HMRC - you will need a suitable account at a bank or building society</li>
				<li>it runs automatically - once set up, you don't have to remember to make payments</li>
				<li>you can choose to pay monthly or six monthly</li>
				<li>it helps your budgeting - for people in business, good cash flow and budgeting are essential and paying by Direct Debit means that your payments are always made in arrears of your liability</li>
				<li>it gives you peace of mind - payments are made on time, every time and there is no risk of losing benefit because you forgot to pay</li>
			</ul>

			<p>If you are unable to pay by Direct Debit, HMRC will issue you with bill reminders in April and October showing the amount due by 31 July and 31 January respectively.</p>
