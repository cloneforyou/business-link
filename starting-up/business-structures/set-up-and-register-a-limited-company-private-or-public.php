		<p>Before your business can begin operating as a limited company, it has to be registered with the Registrar of Companies at Companies House. <b>Incorporation</b> is the process by which a new or existing business is formed as a company.</p>
		<p>This guide will help you understand the registration process and looks at the requirements that different types of companies must meet. It focuses mainly on private companies limited by shares, but will also highlight some of the specific requirements for private companies limited by guarantee and public companies.</p>
		<p>You can incorporate the company yourself, but should seek <b>professional advice</b> before you do so to ensure that incorporation is right for you. A company formation agent, solicitor, accountant or chartered secretary can, for a fee, carry out the process for you and offer you advice.</p>
		<p>You can <a href="/do-it-online/incorporate-your-company-online.php">incorporate your limited company online with Companies House</a> using the web incorporation service, for incorporating a private company, limited by shares, with model articles of association.</p>
