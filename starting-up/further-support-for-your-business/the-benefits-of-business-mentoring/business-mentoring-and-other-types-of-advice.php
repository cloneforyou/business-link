			<h1>The benefits of business mentoring</h1>
			<h2>Business mentoring and other types of advice</h2>
			<p>Using a business mentor is one way of helping you make the right decisions for your business, but there are other forms of support you could consider. These include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>coaching</li>
				<li>peer mentoring and peer learning alliances</li>
				<li>networking</li>
				<li>professional advice</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Coaching</h3>
			<p>Specific short-term business issues can be addressed through coaching which has similar elements as mentoring. There are many organisations that offer coaching services.</p>
			
			<h3>Peer mentoring and peer learning alliances</h3>
			<p>You can also get help or advice from other people in a similar situation, such as people of a similar age or background. When setting up a business, this is likely to involve contacting someone who is also trying to set up a business and faces similar issues. Like business mentoring, this can be as formal or informal as you like.</p>
			
			<h3>Networking</h3>
			<p>The wider world of networking allows you to meet a range of business people. You can do this at a local level - by talking to other business people in your area - or at a much broader level, eg through social networking websites and professional networks such as LinkedIn, Plaxo and Ecademy.</p>
			<p>Sources of information about local networking groups or meetings are available from your local Chamber of Commerce, business advisers or trade associations. There are also Business Collaboration Networks - part of a range of support offered through the government's Solutions for Business portfolio. Solutions for Business is a package of products and services designed to help businesses start, grow and succeed.</p>
