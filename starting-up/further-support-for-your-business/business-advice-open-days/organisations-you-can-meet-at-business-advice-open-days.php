			<h1>Business Advice Open Days</h1>
			<h2>Organisations you can meet at Business Advice Open Days</h2>
			<p>At a Business Advice Open Day, you can meet people who have expert knowledge on a variety of business issues - from turning your idea into a successful business, to finding sources of help when you need them.</p>
			<p>You can also make sure you are complying with the law in key areas such as health and safety, employment law and taxation.</p>
			<p>The line-up of each event depends on the size of the venue. However, some of the key national partners that you can speak to at many of the open days include:</p>
