			<h1>Extra help and support available for your start up</h1>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<p>If you run a start-up business as an entrepreneur, there may be extra help available for you if you are a woman, over 50, disabled, from a minority ethnic group, a young entrepreneur, or if you are on a low income.</p>
			<p>Much of this help takes the form of mentoring and networking - but you should also be able to access targeted advice, support and even apply for loans and grants.</p>
			<p>This guide will explain about sources of funding that might be available to you and where to get help, advice and training.</p>
