		<h2>Introduction</h2>

		<p>Every new business needs money when starting up. The majority of businesses will need to buy equipment, establish the workplace and meet marketing costs - all before the first sale is made. Once you're trading, you'll need cash to pay the bills and keep the business going.</p>
		<p>There are a range of financing options when starting up and choosing the right ones for your business needs is essential. You might be able to use your own money, or you may need money from an external source or investor - eg from banks, family and friends or outside investors. You may also be eligible for grants and government support.</p>
		<p>Most businesses use a combination of these alternatives, according to their specific needs and circumstances.</p>
		<p>This guide will help you to work out how much money you need for setting up your business, the various financing options available for your business and their advantages and disadvantages.
