		<h1>Use your business plan to get funding</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<img src="/_img/FB0030s.gif" width="78" height="118" alt="" />
		<p>A business plan is essential for your enterprise. Whether your business is starting up or already established, your business plan is your roadmap for future development.</p>
		<p>Your business plan is also a key document when you are looking for business funding - whether applying for an overdraft or looking for new investment or capital. It must help investors and lenders understand your vision and goals, explain how you are going to spend the invested or borrowed money and set out how this will benefit both them and the business.</p>
		<p>This guide explains what you should include in your business plan and how you should present it to potential investors, shareholders and your bank.</p>
