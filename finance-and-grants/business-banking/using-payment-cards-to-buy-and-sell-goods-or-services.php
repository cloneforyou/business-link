		<h1>Using payment cards to buy and sell goods or services</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		
		<img src="/_img/vat_reciepts.jpg" width="94" height="62" alt="" />

		<p>Using payment cards - such as credit or debit cards - can provide many benefits for your business. As a buyer, they offer a range of alternative ways of paying for goods or services instead of using cash or cheques. And, as a seller, accepting these cards could help you sell more and reach new customers.</p>
		<p>This guide looks at the different types of payment cards available - including charge cards and pre-paid cards - their pros and cons, and how these might help you manage your business' expenditure.</p>
		<p>The guide also outlines what's involved in setting up your business to accept card payments from customers and key things you should consider first. For example, the additional costs involved like transaction fees, the risk of financial losses due to card fraud and security measures that can help your business reduce this risk.</p>
