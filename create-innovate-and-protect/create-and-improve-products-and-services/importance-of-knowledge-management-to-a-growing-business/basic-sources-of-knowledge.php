			<h1>Importance of knowledge management to a growing business</h1>
			<h2>Basic sources of knowledge</h2>
			<p>Whatever the size of your business, there are many sources of business knowledge, including the following.</p>
			
			<h3>Customer knowledge</h3>
			<p>You should know your customers' needs and what they think of you. You may be able to develop mutually beneficial knowledge-sharing relationships with customers by talking to them about their future requirements, and discussing how you might be able to develop your own products or services to ensure that you meet their needs. See our guide <a href="/sales-and-marketing/keeping-your-customers/know-your-customers-needs.php">know your customers' needs</a>.</p>
			
			<h3>Employee and supplier relationships</h3>
			<p>Seek the opinions of your employees and your suppliers - they'll have their own impressions of how you're performing. You can use formal surveys to gather this knowledge or ask for their views on a more informal basis. See our guides on how to <a href="/employment-and-skills/staff-motivation-and-performance/lead-and-motivate-your-staff.php">lead and motivate your staff</a> and <a href="/grow-your-business/growth-through-strategic-sourcing/manage-your-suppliers.php">manage your suppliers</a>.</p>
			
			<h3>Market knowledge</h3>
			<p>Watch developments in your sector. How are your competitors performing? How much are they charging? Are there any new entrants to the market? Have any significant new products been launched? See our guides on how to <a href="/sales-and-marketing/marketing/understand-your-competitors.php">understand your competitors</a> and <a href="/sales-and-marketing/marketing/market-research-and-market-reports.php">market research and market reports</a>.</p>
			
			<h3>Knowledge of the business environment</h3>
			<p>Developments in politics, the economy, technology, society and the environment could all affect your business' development, so you need to keep yourself informed. You could consider setting up a team to monitor and report on changes in the business world. See our guide on how to <a href="/employment-and-skills/redundancy-restructures-and-change/inform-and-consult-your-employees.php">inform and consult your employees</a>.</p>
			
			<h3>Professional associations and trade bodies</h3>
			<p>Get information from publications, academic publications, government publications, reports from research bodies, trade and technical magazines. You can <a href="https://www.taforum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">search for a trade association on the Trade Association Forum (TAF) website</a>.</p>
			
			<h3>Trade exhibitions and conferences</h3>
			<p>These can provide an easy way of finding out what your competitors are doing and to see the latest innovations in your sector. See our guide on <a href="/sales-and-marketing/marketing/trade-shows-and-exhibitions.php">trade shows and exhibitions</a> to find out how to get the most out of them.</p>
			
			<h3>Product research and development</h3>
			<p>Scientific and technical research and development can be a vital source of knowledge that can help you create innovative new products - retaining your competitive edge. See our guide on how to <a href="/create-innovate-and-protect/use-innovation-in-your-business/use-innovation-to-start-or-grow-your-business.php">use innovation to start or grow your business</a>.</p>
			
			<h3>Organisational memory</h3>
			<p>Be careful not to lose the skills or experience your business has built up. You need to find formal ways of sharing your employees' knowledge about the best ways of doing things. For example, you might create procedural guidance based on your employees' best practice. See the page in this guide: <a href="/create-innovate-and-protect/create-and-improve-products-and-services/importance-of-knowledge-management-to-a-growing-business/create-a-knowledge-strategy-for-your-business.php">create a knowledge strategy for your business</a>.</p>
			
			<h3>Non-executive directors</h3>
			<p>Recruiting non-executive directors can be a good way for you to bring on board specialised industry experience and benefit from ready-made contracts. See our guide on <a href="/employment-and-skills/different-types-of-worker/recruiting-directors.php">recruiting directors</a>.</p>
			
			<h3>Collaboration between businesses and associated institutions</h3>
			<p>Groups of businesses or associated institutions with common interests - known as clusters - sometimes join forces in order to share knowledge at an inter-organisational level. See our guide on <a href="/create-innovate-and-protect/use-innovation-in-your-business/manufacturing-innovation.php">manufacturing innovation</a>.</p>
