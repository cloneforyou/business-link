		<h1>Support networks and facilities for innovation and R&amp;D</h1>
		<h2>Assisted areas</h2>
		<p>One of the ways in which the government's development agencies help particular areas to develop is by creating <strong>assisted areas</strong>.</p>
		<p>Assisted areas are those locations where regional aid may be granted under European Union legislation. Businesses based in regions classified as assisted areas may benefit from a grant if they stimulate regional development, urban regeneration or an improvement in employment prospects.</p>
		<p>There are two main assisted area grant schemes in Britain:</p>
		<ul>
			<!-- <li>The Grant for Business Investment (GBI) helps fund new investment projects that lead to long-term improvements in productivity, skills and employment. The scheme is now closed for new applications, except for large exceptional projects and offshore wind equipment. <a href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/whatwedo/regional/investment/page29183.html" target="bgExternalonlinebusinesslinkgovuk" title="Postcode checker and assisted areas map for the RSA scheme">Read about the GBI on the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills (BIS) website</a>.</li> -->
			<li>Regional Selective Assistance (RSA) Scotland is aimed at encouraging new investment projects, strengthening existing employment and new job creation. <a href="https://www.scottish-enterprise.com/knowledge-hub/articles/insight/changes-to-rsa-funding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Find out about RSA Scotland on the Scottish Enterprise website</a>.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Current Assisted Areas Map</h3>
		<p>The current Assisted Areas Map came into effect on 13 February 2007, and remains in force until 31 December 2013. You can <a href="/_img/file38642.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">view the Current Assisted Areas map</a>.</p>
		
		<h3>Regional Growth Fund</h3>
		<p>The Regional Growth Fund (RGF) operates across England from 2011 to 2014. It supports projects that create economic growth and long-term employment. RGF aims particularly to help areas that are currently dependent on the public sector.</p>
