There's no office rent to pay, no need to commute, and the opportunity to build a business around your family life. And thanks to new technology and working practices, it's now possible to run many different types of business from home.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>making sure your idea will work as a home-based business - and having a plan or making it happen</li>
			<li>the practicalities of running a home-based business, including household and company admin</li>
			<li>tips on creating an effective working environment in your home</li>
			<li>how to create the right impression with business contacts &ndash; eg hiring meeting facilities and having a company website</li>
			<li>working on the move - using mobile technology to run your business and stay organised</li>
			<li>growing the business without outgrowing the home &ndash; including outsourcing and work hubs</li>
